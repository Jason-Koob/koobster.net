  <h1>Welcome to Koobster.net</h1>
  <p>Hello and welcome to my website. This is where I post all kinds of things I’m working on or thinking about. I like messing around with tech, diving into games, exploring the outdoors, and writing about whatever catches my interest. I’m always adding new stuff when I can, so feel free to poke around and check back now and then. If you ever want to reach out or ask something, head over to the Contact page.</p>

  <h2><a href="projects.html" id="project">Projects</a></h2>
  <p>This is where I share different projects I’ve worked on. Some are quick weekend builds, others take a lot more time. I’ll go over what I was trying to do, the problems that came up, and how I figured things out. Whether it’s coding, configuring a network, or something else entirely, this section is where it all ends up.</p>

  <h2><a href="articles.html" id="article">Articles</a></h2>
  <p>This is the spot for random write-ups on whatever topic I felt like digging into. Could be tech deep dives, game design thoughts, or just something I found cool. I try to keep things clear and useful, or at least worth a read if you're into the same kind of stuff I am.</p>
  
  <h2><a href="contact.html" id="contact">Contact</a></h2>
  <p>If you want to get in touch, head over to the Contact page. I'm always open to hearing from you, whether it's about an interesting project, an intriguing article, or just to say hi. I will try my best to respond to emails.</p>
