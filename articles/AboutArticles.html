  <h2>Why I Write Articles</h2>
  <p>Writing articles allows me to share knowledge, document my learning journey, and connect with others who have similar interests. I enjoy exploring new topics, conducting research, and presenting information in a way that is engaging and accessible to those who are interested.</p>
  <p>I think that writing these articles is easier to manage, as I can modify a template I have, put it in a folder, and begin writing the article. This may not be the best way to do this, but it works for me.</p>
  <p>Additionally, writing articles helps me to clarify my own understanding of the topics I cover. By explaining concepts in my own words, I can identify any gaps in my knowledge and address them more effectively.</p>
  <h2>Future Topics</h2>
  <p>In the future, I plan to write articles on a variety of topics, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>More Coding Projects</li>
    <li>Networking Projects</li>
    <li>Personal Development</li>
    <li>Life Experiences</li>
  </ul>
